# Naive-Bayes-multinomial-classifier-for-fake-news-detection

The naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm, is employed in this context to classify news sentences as either genuine or fake. By leveraging the underlying probabilities of word occurrences in the dataset, the classifier efficiently discerns patterns and features in the data, enabling accurate and automated identification of fake news sentences.
